        It has been a while (more than two years, in fact) since I last wrote here. The funny
        (and slightly embarrassing) part is that my previous post was all about how I did not want to
        neglect this blog anymore.
        <br />
        <br />
        Life had other plans. Between work, cycling all around Milan, and the steady rhythm of my
        routines, the days slipped into months and, eventually, into years. On the surface it might
        look like nothing changed: I am in the same city, riding the same bike, and working the same
        job. But beneath that familiar surface I have been busy growing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Over these twenty four months I have tackled new projects, expanded my skills, and taken on
        challenges I would have never imagined back in 2023. Each experience has pushed me forward,
        both professionally and personally, and it feels good to pause for a moment and recognize that
        progress.
        <br />
        <br />
        With so much going on, the blog kept getting pushed aside. Again. But here I am, ready to give
        it another shot and breathe a little life back into this space. Maybe this time the momentum
        will stick. Or maybe future me will circle back in another two years to write a similar post,
        let us hope not!
        <br />
        <br />
        Either way, it feels great to be back. Thanks for sticking around, and see you in the next
        update.

        Hello everyone and welcome back to my blog!
        <br />
        <br />
        For those who do not know me, my name is Daniele Barile and I aspire to become an excellent
        Full Stack Developer.
        <br />
        <br />
        Yes. I acknowledge that I have been neglecting my site for the past few months.
        <br />
        <br />
        I recently noticed it and I do not like it, I want to try to keep it updated as much as
        possible.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hoping you accept my apologies, here are the updates of the last months!
        <br />
        <br />
        My app has had a lot of success! (sike). In reality I was thinking of doing a mini advertising
        campaign but I do not know how to do it and I will inform myself.
        <br />
        <br />
        At the beginning of summer, almost a year after I moved here to Milan, I bought a motorcycle!
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to the passion for information technology I have a huge passion for motorcycles :)
        <br />
        <br />
        It is a Yamaha R7, and I love it.
        <br />
        <br />
        My summer was very quiet, I traveled a lot around Italy on my R7 with my girlfriend and it was
        very nice. (check my insta and tiktok)
        <br />
        <br />
        As always, I have some projects in mind and some work in progress, now that September begins I
        am very excited to get back on track!
        <br />
        <br />
        Stay tuned to receive all the updates!
        <br />
        <br />
        That is all for today gentlemen :)
        <br />
        <br />
        Happy coding :)

        Hello everyone and welcome back to my blog!

        Full Stack Developer.

        <br />
        Today I am so happy to announce that my first Android app is online!
        <br />
        <br />
        I do not want to go into explaining what it is, as that is not the purpose of this article.
        <br />
        <br />
        I will just leave you the link to download it from
        {" "}
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.internet_checker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          Google Play
        </a>
        .
        <br />
        <br />
        These past two months have been very productive, besides the release of my app I have also
        developed a discord bot. Mainly because I had a need and I could not find anything on the net
        that could help me.
        <br />
        <br />
        The bot in question allows you to control an Aternos server (Minecraft) directly from Discord,
        without having to go to the dedicated dashboard and open a browser.
        <br />
        <br />
        For those who are curious, I leave the link to the repository in the post button. For those who
        want to use the bot instead, just look for it on
        {" "}
        <a href="https://top.gg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          top.gg
        </a>
        {" "}
        with the name "AternoServerController".
        <br />
        <br />
        Beyond this I have some projects in mind, which maybe I will tell you about later.
        <br />
        <br />
        Stay tuned to receive all the updates!
        <br />
        <br />
        That is all for today gentlemen :)

        I have not posted any updates on the development of the mobile app I had in mind for too long.
        <br />
        <br />
        And here is a big update on the situation:
        <br />
        <br />
        After a long analysis I decided to shelve the development of that app, in favor of another one
        that is now in the testing phase.
        <br />
        <br />
        A first release has been made.
        <br />
        <br />
        Internal and open tests are currently underway on the Google Play Store.
        <br />
        <br />
        I cannot wait to release it to the public!
        <br />
        <br />
        Stay tuned to receive all the updates!

        Hi, welcome to my blog.
        <br />
        <br />
        My name is Daniele Barile and I aspire to become an excellent Full Stack Developer.
        <br />
        <br />
        I would say that I am still at the beginning but actually I have four years of experience in
        application development.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am interested almost in everything: client development, server development, frontend, and
        backend.
        <br />
        <br />
        I like to improve myself and to play with unknown technologies.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this blog I will publish articles of any kind, all about (or almost) what wanders in my head.
        <br />
        <br />
        This site was my first experiment with ReactJS (very interesting); if you want to take a look at
        the code, you can find a button in the article preview that will bring you to the repo.
        <br />
        <br />
        At this point, I think I have said it all for now.
        <br />
        <br />
        Happy coding :)
